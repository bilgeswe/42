# 🧠 42 Projects – Dive Deep, Climb High 🌊🏔

Welcome to my collection of projects from the legendary [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) – where learning is 100% hands-on, peer-powered, and fueled by pure curiosity. Whether you're here to peek into my progress or dive into the code, you're more than welcome!

> 🚀 Built through the grind of the **Piscine** and beyond – one shell command, one pointer bug, and one late-night coffee at a time.

## 🧭 About 42

[42](https://42.fr/en/admissions/42-piscine/) is not your average school. It has no teachers, no lectures, and no tuition fees. It's an international, tuition-free, peer-to-peer coding school with a unique philosophy:

- 📚 Learn by doing.
- 🤝 Collaborate, don’t compete.
- 🧩 Solve real problems, not just exercises.
- 💡 Fail. Retry. Learn. Repeat.

I’m currently attending [42 Istanbul](https://42istanbul.com.tr/) – where the tech spirit meets Bosphorus brilliance.
